This website is built on top of the Agency base bootstrap theme provided by Start Bootstrap, available here: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/

To continue work on this project, you first need to make sure your enviroment supports SCSS and Node.js.

1. Install npm on your local machine.

2. Install Node.js via npm

3. Install gulp via npm

4. Run the following command in Windows command prompt: 'npm install gulp-cli -g'

5. Now just run 'gulp dev' in the dir where the project is stored and edit in realtime. 

To aid further development, I have extensively used comments and descriptors throughout the initial development. A table of contents is available in the storyslam.css-stylesheet.
To change the CSS properties of the website, open the module SCSS-sheet, make your changes and either let the 'gulp dev'-command above auto-update, or manually run the terminal command 'gulp css'.
This process compules all the SCSS-files into a single .css file, which is then minified (meaning extra space is stripped for size) and put in the /css/-folder.


This project was created by Cato Akay and Yanislav Zagorov on behalf of StorySLAM at the Oslo metropolitan university in Oslo, Norway.
